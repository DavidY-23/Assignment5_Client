Current Bugs:
- Users need to click submit twice for the Edit button for Campus for changes to take place
- Users need to refresh the page for Delete button on Campus for changes to take place. I tried to force the page to reload, but the reloading would happen first

This repository is the client (front-end) starter code for Final Project (CRUD Application).

### Use the following steps to set up and run the client (front-end) application on your local machine

2. Start a terminal (e.g., Git Bash) on your local machine.
3.	Go into the "client-starter-code" folder, enter the command to install dependencies: `npm install` 
4.	Start the client application by entering the command: `npm start` 
5.	After the client application is successfully started, a web browser is automatically opened at the address: `http://localhost:3000`
